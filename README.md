# Brainfuck Interpreter

Really simple Brainfuck interpreter, I'm not really sure about usage, figure that out yourself hahaha.

No support for ASCII encoding, might add some more modifications for support, but aside from that the only real next step to the project is to actually compile, rather than rely on `ocamlc` to do the work for me hahah.
